## Try it locally

1. Make sure `pixi` and `git` are installed. [Instructions for `pixi`](https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/).
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jaimergp/conda-self`
3. Change to that directory: `cd conda-self`
4. Run the help message: `pixi run conda self --help`

We _could_ just use the default pixi env to try things, but it doesn't write a good `history` file, so `conda self` will misunderstand what to do and remove everything sometimes. For now, let's use this default conda to create a demo environment to do things with:

1. Create a demo environment with `conda` and `pip`: `pixi run conda create -p .pixi/envs/demo conda pip`
2. Pseudo-activate it: `conda spawn ./.pixi/envs/demo`.
3. Install conda-self in it `pip install -e .`
4. Play with `python -m conda self`
   1. `python -m conda self install numpy`
   2. `python -m conda self install conda-rich`
   3. `python -m conda self update`
   4. `python -m conda self remove conda-rich`
